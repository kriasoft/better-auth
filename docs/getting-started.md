# Getting Started

> ðŸš§ **Note:** This project is currently under active development. APIs and features may change before the stable release.

## Overview

Better Auth Plugins is a collection of 17 enterprise-grade plugins that extend [Better Auth](https://better-auth.com) with powerful features like cloud storage integration, advanced security, analytics, and more.

## Prerequisites

- **Better Auth** v0.5.0 or higher
- **Node.js** 18+ or **Bun** 1.0+
- **TypeScript** 5.0+ (recommended)

## Installation

Install the plugins you need via your preferred package manager:

```bash
# Using Bun (recommended)
bun add better-auth-feature-flags better-auth-storage

# Using npm
npm install better-auth-feature-flags better-auth-storage

# Using pnpm
pnpm add better-auth-feature-flags better-auth-storage

# Using yarn
yarn add better-auth-feature-flags better-auth-storage
```

## Basic Setup

Configure Better Auth with your chosen plugins:

```typescript
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { featureFlags } from "better-auth-feature-flags";
import { storagePlugin } from "better-auth-storage";
import { analyticsPlugin } from "better-auth-analytics";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  // Your Better Auth config
  database: {
    // ...
  },

  // Add plugins
  plugins: [
    featureFlags({
      storage: "database",
      analytics: { trackUsage: true },
    }),
    storagePlugin({
      providers: ["google-drive", "onedrive"],
    }),
    analyticsPlugin({
      trackEvents: true,
    }),
  ],
});
```

## Client-Side Setup

For client-side functionality, import from the plugin's client module:

```typescript
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client";
import { featureFlagsClient } from "better-auth-feature-flags/client";
import { storageClient } from "better-auth-storage/client";

const client = createAuthClient({
  plugins: [featureFlagsClient(), storageClient()],
});

// Use feature flags
const isNewFeatureEnabled = await client.featureFlags.isEnabled("new-feature");
```
